# Security Policy

We take the security and privacy of our projects seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within any of our repositories, we encourage you to report it as quickly as possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Contact Us Privately**: Please send an email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) with the details of the vulnerability. Do not open a public GitHub issue.

2. **Provide Detailed Information**: Include as much information as possible in your report, such as:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - The potential impact of the vulnerability.
   - Any suggestions for how the vulnerability might be mitigated or fixed.

3. **Our Response**: 
   - We aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within 3-5 business days. However, as a small organization, our response time may vary. We promise that even if there are delays, we will review your report and respond as soon as we are able.
   - If you do not receive a response within 7 to 10 days, please feel free to resend your report. 
   - In the unlikely event that you still havenâ€™t received a response after 14 buisness days, we implore you to pester us again.

4. **Disclosure**:
   - Once the vulnerability has been addressed, we will work with you to coordinate the public disclosure of the vulnerability and the fix.
   - We prefer responsible disclosure and aim to credit the reporting individual or entity in the release notes, unless you wish to remain anonymous.

## Security Best Practices

To help prevent vulnerabilities in our repositories, we follow industry best practices for secure coding, regular audits, and maintaining up-to-date dependencies. We also encourage contributors to follow secure coding practices when contributing to our projects.
